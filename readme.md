A bad blog which you should only read if you like reading bad blogs very
infrequently.

Notes to self:

wintersmith-stylus seems to break with stylus version greater than
0.41.3. Particularly, once glob starts being used, it shits all over
itself and dies. But not when run from the command line, just in
wintersmith-stylus. I need to determine if this is a problem with
wintersmith-stylus or with stylus itself.

For now, since I'm lazy, just force 0.41.3.

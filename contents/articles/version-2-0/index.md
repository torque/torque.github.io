Well, it's been a while.

Two years, actually, if you round up. I've decided to resurrect one of
the corpses in my closet. It's not perfect, but I'd like to delude
myself into thinking that it's better than its previous iteration.

After all, look at these flippin' fabulous features for, uh, formatting!

We have code blocks with decent syntax highlighting:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// This is stupid.
int main( int argc, char **argv ) {
	for ( int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i ) {
		puts( "This is stupid." );
	}
}
```

We have footnotes[^footnote].

We have tables:

|   It    | does  |   not    |
|:--------|:-----:|---------:|
|  make   | sense |    to    |
| present | this  | sentence |
|   in    |   a   | tabular  |
| format  |   .   |

We have beautiful math typesetting[^mathneedsjs]:

$$
\alpha^n(\rho,z) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}\left(\frac{\rho^{i}}{\sqrt[i]{z}}\right)
$$

We have

# "Typography"---<span class="smallcaps">features</span>...

And we have me apologizing for doing that.

At any rate, I'm terrifically excited to embark on my ~~brand new~~
fully-refurbished-with-90-day-warranty blogging career, in which I will
use none of these features[^orwilli] as I am not an accomplished
programmer, nor an accomplished mathematician, nor do I have data to
present in tables.

Not that it would even matter if I were one of those things, because a
mere glance at my personal track record with regards to writing things
could convince someone with even the most crippling gambling addiction
to bet with the odds that this won't get updated terribly often.


[^footnote]: Which will even show up in-place if the stars align
properly.

[^mathneedsjs]: As long as you believe in javascript, at least.

[^orwilli]: Excepting, of course, footnotes, as they are great and
also a hilariously inconvenient way to present information.
